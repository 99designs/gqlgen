## What is gqlgen?

[gqlgen](https://github.com/monzo/gqlgen) is a golang library for building graphql servers without any fuss. gqlgen is:

 - Schema first: You define your API using the graphql [Schema Definition Language](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/)
 - Type safe: You should never see `map[string]interface{}` here.
 - Codegen: Let us generate the boring bits, so you can build your app quickly. 


## Getting started

First take a look at the [Getting Started]({{< ref "getting-started.md" >}}) tutorial.

If you cant find what your looking for, maybe the [examples](https://github.com/monzo/gqlgen/tree/master/example) will help.
