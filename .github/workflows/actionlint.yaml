# we do NOT use pull_request_target because
# workflow runs that are triggered by forks from events:
#  - push,
#  - pull_request,
#  - pull_request_review
#  - pull_request_review_comment
# will be treated as if they were opened from a repository fork.
# This means they will receive a read-only GITHUB_TOKEN
# and will not have access to any secrets available in the repository.
#
# This will cause any workflows that attempt to write to the repository to fail.
# When a new revision is pushed to a PR, cancel all in-progress CI runs for that
# PR. See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency
