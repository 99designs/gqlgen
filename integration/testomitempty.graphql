    # float32 needs a scalar because precision changes by converting to float64 and back to float32 while marshalling/unmarshalling
    # for example, value of 5.76 comes out as 5.760000228881836, anyone knows how to fix this?
    newFloat32: Float32!

    # uint64 needs a scalar because it is bigger than int64
